# Telecom Churn - Case Study
> Telecom Churn case study is focused on building ML models to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future and also to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn.

## Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage and identify the main indicators of churn.


## Solution Approach
1. Data Understanding, Preparation, and Pre-Processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation
4. Model Selection, Model Building, and Prediction
5. Prediction on test.csv data for Kaggle submission
6. Analysing main indicators of churn
